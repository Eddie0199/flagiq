        <p>
          These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the FlagIQ
          mobile application (the "App"), published by WildMoustacheGames
          ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to
          these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 13 years old, or the minimum age required by your
          jurisdiction, to use the App. If you are between 13 and 18, you
          represent that you have parental consent.
        </p>

        <h2>2. License to Use</h2>
        <p>
          We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
          license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may
          not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App except
          as permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the App for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose;</li>
          <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code

          <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App or servers connected to the App;</li>
          <li>Upload or transmit malicious code, malware, or other harmful content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The App, including all content, features, and functionality, is owned
          by WildMoustacheGames or its licensors and is protected by copyright,
          trademark, and other laws. "FlagIQ" and associated graphics are our
          trademarks or registered trademarks.
        </p>

        <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>
          If the App offers optional purchases, all sales are final except where
          refunds are required by applicable law or the app store's policies.
          You are responsible for reviewing the purchase terms provided by the
          app store.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The App may link to or rely on third-party services. Those services are
          governed by their own terms and privacy policies. We are not
          responsible for third-party content or services.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if we
          believe you have violated these Terms or if required by law. You may
          stop using the App at any time.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          The App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of
          any kind, whether express or implied, including implied warranties of
          merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
          We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or
          error-free.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, WildMoustacheGames will not be
          liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
          damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising from your use of the
          App. Our total liability for any claim related to the App is limited to
          the amount you paid (if any) for the App in the 12 months preceding the
          claim.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold harmless WildMoustacheGames and its
          officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages,
          liabilities, and expenses arising out of your use of the App or
          violation of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. We will update the
          "Effective Date" when changes occur. Continued use of the App after
          changes means you accept the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where
          WildMoustacheGames is established, without regard to conflict of law
          principles. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of courts
          in that location.
