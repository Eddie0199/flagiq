        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: January 1, 2025</p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how WildMoustacheGames ("we," "us," or
          "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the FlagIQ
          mobile application (the "App") and visit our legal pages hosted at
          wildmoustachegames.com.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          FlagIQ is designed as a casual, offline-friendly game. We aim to
          minimize the data we collect:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Game progress data:</strong> Stored locally on your device to
            remember your preferences, scores, and progress.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support communications:</strong> If you contact us at
            <a href="mailto:support@wildmoustachegames.com">support@wildmoustachegames.com</a>,
            we collect the information you provide in that email so we can assist
            you.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect sensitive personal information such as
          government identifiers, financial information, or precise location data.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect solely to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide, maintain, and improve FlagIQ;</li>
          <li>Respond to support requests and communicate with you;</li>
          <li>Monitor basic app functionality (such as saving your progress).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell your personal information. We only share information in
          these situations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Service providers:</strong> Vendors that help us operate the
            App (for example, cloud hosting) may process data on our behalf under
            confidentiality obligations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal compliance:</strong> If required to comply with
            applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;
            to enforce our Terms &amp; Conditions; or to protect the rights,
            property, or safety of WildMoustacheGames, our users, or others.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Game progress data remains on your device unless you delete the App or
          your device storage. Support communications are retained only as long
          as necessary to resolve your inquiry or as required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
          protect information. No method of transmission or storage is completely
          secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children&#8217;s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          FlagIQ is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
          collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a
          child has provided us information, contact us so we can delete it.
        </p>

        <h2>7. International Users</h2>
        <p>
          Your information may be processed in countries other than your own.
          These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in
          your jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Local data:</strong> You can delete local game data by

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the
          "Effective Date" above when changes are made. Continued use of the App
          after an update means you accept the revised policy.
